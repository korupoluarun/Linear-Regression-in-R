### Description of variables###
# mpg 	Miles/(US) gallon
# cyl 	Number of cylinders
# disp 	Displacement (cu.in.)
# hp 	Gross horsepower
# drat 	Rear axle ratio
# wt 	Weight (lb/1000)
# qsec 	1/4 mile time
# vs 	V/S
# am 	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
# gear 	Number of forward gears
# carb 	Number of carburetors


# Step 0: 
# assign data set to a dataframe name cars

# Step 1: Descriptive analysis of variables
# Further create a box plot and a histogram to understand the spread of data for weight, mileage variables
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # this particular command allows arranging graphs you create into rows and columns



hist(cars$hp)  # histogram of horsepower
hist(cars$wt)  # histogram of weights of cars
hist(cars$mpg) # histogram of mileage data
hist(cars$cyl) # histogram of number of engine cylinders

boxplot(cars$mpg, main = "spread of mileage") # boxplot of mileage data

# here our task is to identify the skew of the distribution and infer any interesting insights and make notes


# Step 2: Trying to understand the relationship between variables
# create a scatter plot to understand the relationship between weight and mileage
# create a scatter plot to understand the relationship between weight and horsepower
# create a scatter plot to understand the relationship between horsepower and mileage 
# create a scatter plot to understand the relationship between number of cyalinders and engine displacment

# if you want to quantify the linear relations
# The correlation coefficient of two variables in a data set 
# equals to their covariance divided by the product of their
# individual standard deviations. It is a normalized measurement 
# of how the two are linearly related

# correlation of +1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship
# corrleation of 0 indicates no linear relationship
# corrÃ¶leation of -1 indicates a strong negative relationship

cor(cars$wt, cars$mpg) # indicates a negative linear relationship
cor(cars$hp, cars$disp) # indicates a positive linear relationsip
